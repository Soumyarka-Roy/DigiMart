We as a group have taken the initiative and have developed a functional android application for onboarding local merchants on a digital platform. Our aim behind developing the project is to give them a platform to showcase their product and sell their product to a large customer base through our app. This app will not only help the merchants to increase their sales but will also make the life of people easy and comfortable as now they will be able to shop from their nearby trusted shop with the ease and comfort of their home. We have developed this app for android compatible devices for the time being. We have worked with android studio for developing the application. Features of Google firebase are being used to build the authentication, database, storage and login-signup functionality. The fundamental language used to program the application is “JAVA”.
